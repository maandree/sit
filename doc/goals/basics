- Anyone with a copy of the repository should have full access to
  the issue tracker so you will never lose all information in it.

- Anyone with push access to a repository should have full
  control of the issue tracker offline. That is, developers
  should be able to browse the issue tracker even without
  Internet access, and even make edits and additions to it.

- The base should be as small and simple as possible.

- UTF-8 everywhere (some systems do not even support Unicode.)
