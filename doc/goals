- Anyone with a copy of the repository should have full access to
  the issue tracker so you will never lose all information in it.

- Anyone with push access to a repository should have full
  control of the issue tracker offline. That is, developers
  should be able to browse the issue tracker even without
  Internet access, and even make edits and additions to it.

- A web front-end should not be neccessary, but having one should
  allow anyone to create tickets.

- The web front-end's back-end should run programs to
  access tickets, and not implement everything itself.

- Gopher should be usable to browse the issue tracker.
  (low priority)

- Issues should by default not be attached to a branch, but
  they should be attachable to branches.

- It should be possible to subscribe to the ticket system
  with or without selectors using e-mail, news syndication
  (e.g. RSS), log files and notifications in the terminal.
  It should also be easy to add other systems.

- - This can be used to create a static archive.

- The issue tracker should be controllable with e-mail,
  both by users and moderators.
  (low priority)

- Users should not need to check out branches to access
  issues attached to branches.

- N:M milestones.

- Multiple assignees.

- The base should be as small and simple as possible.

- UTF-8 everywhere (some systems do not even support Unicode.)

- A user can have multiple identities, or rather,
  multiple identities can be grouped to be identified as one user.

- The issue tracker should not automatically close issues it
  believes have been solved, it is up to the developer to
  close it when he and the reportee are in agreement that the
  problem has been solved.

- Discussions are flat, not threaded.

- File attachment support.

- Tickets should have the following tags:

- - Severity
- - Reporter
- - Status
- - Categories
- - CVE-ID
- - Branch where the issue is being resolved
- - Due date
- - Creation date
- - Known affect versions
- - Known unaffect versions
- - (any tag mentioned elsewhere)

- Voting to indicate interest in seeing an issue
  getting resolved.

- Duplicates should be hidden under the original.
