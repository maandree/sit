- The issue tracker should not automatically close issues it
  believes have been solved, it is up to the developer to
  close it when he and the reportee are in agreement that the
  problem has been solved.

- Closed issues are closed, reopening require editing
  the issue tracker's files manually.

- Discussions are flat, not threaded.
