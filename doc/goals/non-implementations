- The issue tracker should not automatically close issues it
  believes have been solved, it is up to the developer to
  close it when he and the reportee are in agreement that the
  problem has been solved.

- Closed issues are closed, reopening require editing
  the issue tracker's files manually.

- Discussions are flat, not threaded.

- All timestamps are in Unix time, and there is not time
  string parsing. (Front-ends are exempt.)

- - If you want to for example set a date to "next month 00:00",
    you will have to use an external tool. If you have GNU
    coreutils you can type `$(date -d "next month 00:00" +%s)`.

- - If you want to a timestamp to be represent in human-readable
    form, you will have to convert it with an external tool. If
    you have GNU coreutils you can type `date -d @$TIMESTAMP`.
